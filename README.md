# README

This is the Illumina Therapy website for Ladan. It was created as a playground for building a performant small website on a more modern stack.

It is based on [next.js](https://nextjs.org) The backend is using the [Payload CMS](https://payloadcms.com) and is placed inside the next.js application.

This allows you to host the whole website in a single [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) or [AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/de/amplify) instance.

It is Code-first by design and all tools used are Open-Source and free. This is useful since any Squarespace or Webflow project will cost you at least 300 â‚¬ a year.
